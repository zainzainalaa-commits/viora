## Why Harbor

**Harbor** is a self contained desktop client for the Stremio ecosystem. Out of the box it runs on Cinemeta. Add a free TMDB key and it blossoms into your ultimate companion for discovering and watching content. Harbor was built around the Stremio addon ecosystem with deep native integration of popular services and features into the UI. 

- **A native player.** libmpv decodes virtually any codec and container, with HDR passthrough, skip intro/outro, Anime4K upscaling shaders, and more. Delivering the same quality you are used to, but on a native custom player.
- **Customize it your way.** Harbor is built in rust and tauri, allowing full on demand customization of the entire application. Harbor does not inject into stremio web, it is its own from scratch shell, layered over the stremio ecosystem, allowing you to go beyond the traditional themeing. Customize the player's UI, your fonts, seek bar, colors or the entire thing! 
- **Theme Studio & Editor** Noob friendly theme studio lets anyone create their own custom theme with no code. Those that want control over every file can use a built in code editor for your themes.
- **Intelligent stream ranking.** A pure Rust engine (compiled to WASM, with a TypeScript fallback) that parses every stream, filters out scams and fakes, and ranks high quality sources first.
- **Corpus Engine.** During the initial release of In-cinema movies, Harbor gates the results based on heuristic factors like file size, average quality consensus, year and metadata ranking and other factors to deliver you a cleaner experience during the period of a fresh release. Harbor will surface the most likely CAMS, TeleSyncs/Telecines and other reasonable options without you needing to do anything.
- **Go Deep.** Dive deep into your favorite shows, actors, genres and more. View lists of award recipients for the Oscars, BAFTA, Cannes, SAG, and more. Anime cast and award metadata, along with Episode/Season Deduplication and Merge. Your rows learn from your watch history and likes, to always suggest you your next best watch.
- **Robust Appstore.** Harbor allows you to configure and install addons without leaving the desktop client by allowing you to natively install third party addons via a built in viewport. Easily manage your installed Addons and Browse for new ones in a bespoke experience that merges the Stremio Community addons API with the [Stremio-addons.net](https://stremio-addons.net) API, giving you wide coverage and custom reccomendations.
- **Stremio-addons.net Integration.** The first platform with direct community ratings, top trending, and manifest feed to the [Stremio-addons.net](https://stremio-addons.net) API
- **Watch together, on your own relay.** A synced watch party with live on screen cursors and drawing, on a relay that deploys to your own Cloudflare account in one click. No central server.
- **Live TV and Multiview.** Bring M3U or Xtream playlists and get a real EPG grid guide, favorites, catchup, and up to four channels at once in a grid. Missed the show? play a rerun or record the next episode using built in DVR. Switch channels while in the live player at any time with the TV Guide
- **Stream switcher** In player switcher allows you to hop streams if you get served a bad one without leaving the player and going through results again. Play next episodes with ease on the player UI controls or in a full "Next Up" sidebar. 
- **Casts across the room.** DLNA/UPnP, Chromecast, AirPlay, and Roku via a bundled Rust cast server and a web cast receiver.
- **Integrations.** Feature rich discord rich presence integration, webhooks for Discord and Telegram, Trakt Sync, and native integrations to TMDB, OMDB, Fanart.Tv, RPDB and more! Customize the  location and what badges are shown.
- **And much more! (seriously this would be very long)**

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">&#9650; back to top</a></p>

### The stream engine

When you press play, Harbor collects stream offers from every installed addon in parallel and runs them through a four stage pipeline. Inside the desktop app this runs in **harbor-core**, a pure Rust crate compiled to WASM and invoked from the UI, with a TypeScript fallback if it is ever unavailable.

```
parse  ->  trust  ->  score  ->  rank
```

| Stage | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Parse** | Extracts resolution, HDR flavor (Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, HLG), video codec, source type, audio codec and channel layout (Atmos, TrueHD, DTS-HD MA, 5.1/7.1), languages, file size, seeders, container, release group, edition tags, season/episode, and an anime aware filename pass for CRC and batch ranges |
| **Trust** | Drops dead links, placeholders, cams and telecines, trailers and extras, undersized stubs, cinema window fakes, and title, year, season, or episode mismatches; floats well regarded release groups upward |
| **Score** | Rewards debrid cached sources, resolution, HDR and lossless audio, seeders, trusted release groups, REMUX, and preferred language matches; penalizes cams, mismatches, and implausible sizes. Every signal is recorded so the reason is inspectable |
| **Rank** | Sorts into quality tiers (4K DV, 4K HDR, 4K, 1080p HDR, 1080p, 720p, SD) and surfaces the best cached pick first, with partial results streamed to the UI as addons respond |

Debrid services are checked live and uniformly: **Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, Premiumize, Debrid-Link, and TorBox**. Cache hints embedded by popular addons are read directly, and every torrent hash is cross checked against your debrid library to catch what the cache API misses. No debrid is required: Harbor can stream torrents directly through the bundled Stremio Server engine. All keys stay on your device.

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">&#9650; back to top</a></p>

### The player

A native libmpv player, with HLS and MPEG-TS engines for live and broadcast sources, and an Auto mode that picks the right backend per source.

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Engines** | Native libmpv (bundled) or HTML5/WebView2, with an Auto mode; hls.js and mpegts.js for live; embedded or separate window mpv |
| **Resilience** | Auto retry and auto advance that detect black screens, frozen positions, and hard stalls; fallback to the Stremio Server HLS transcoder on a decode error; automatic live IPTV reconnect |
| **Picture** | HDR passthrough, HDR to SDR tonemapping (bt.2446a), Anime4K GLSL upscaling shaders, a stats overlay |
| **Skip segments** | Intro, outro, and recap detection from AniSkip, TheIntroDB, and embedded chapter markers |
| **Subtitles** | OpenSubtitles v3 and Wyzie plus your subtitle addons, deduped and language ranked; SRT/VTT/ASS/SUB with encoding detection; **dual tracks**; full styling (font, size, color, outline, box, margin, alignment, custom font upload); SDH and forced flags; ASS override; per item delay; and a show/hide toggle in picture in picture |
| **Resume and sync** | Picks up from your saved position, merged with Stremio library mtime; writes progress back every few seconds and flags watched at 85% |
| **Convenience** | Picture in picture, A/B loop, sleep timer, frame grab, stream download via bundled yt-dlp, next/previous episode with auto advance, and a fully remappable 21 action hotkey set |
| **Seek bar** | Flat, glass, pinstripe, rainbow, or custom image styles; adjustable height, color, and dot shape, or use custom JS, all with a live preview |
| **Player Editor** | Change your players UI layout, style, and more with a 1:1 player editor |

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">&#9650; back to top</a></p>

### Casting

Send any playback across the room through a bundled Rust cast server and a web cast receiver.

- **Chromecast** via Harbor's own CAF receiver (HLS, MP4, and unknown formats). (Visit harborstremio/cast-receiver-chrome)
- **DLNA / UPnP** with vendor aware handling for Samsung, Sony, LG, Panasonic, and Hisense.
- **AirPlay** discovery and playback.
- **Roku** via the ECP protocol, with guidance for network access and Media Assistant. (Pre and post roku update) Does require Roku tv addons
- An optional "always re-encode" path pipes streams through ffmpeg (H264 + AAC + MPEGTS) for maximum receiver compatibility, and playback resumes locally when casting stops.

> [!NOTE]
> Casting support varies by device. Chromecast receiver and DLNA/UPnP are tested and working, with verified success on devices such as Google Nest Hub + Chromecast Dongle and a Samsung Q60T. Apple TV 4K, HomePod, and Vision Pro require AirPlay 2 (Soon); legacy AirPlay 1 is rejected by most modern devices. Roku support is in testing please submit feedback!! If a device does not appear, please open an [issue][issues] with the model so we can expand the matrix.

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">&#9650; back to top</a></p>

### Together: watch parties

- Create or join a room with a six character code; invite by link.
- Synced play, pause, and seek with RTT adjusted clock alignment so everyone stays together.
- Live chat, **on screen cursors** with named colors, and **collaborative drawing** over the video.
- A host can summon everyone to a view or a title and send play invites that late joiners receive on connect.
- The relay deploys to **your own Cloudflare account in one click** (deploy, check, and delete from inside Harbor). There is no central Harbor server in the loop.

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">&#9650; back to top</a></p>

### Live TV and Multiview

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Sources** | M3U playlist URLs, Xtream Codes credentials (auto builds M3U + EPG), and standalone XMLTV; multiple playlists, on demand refresh, edit, delete, and export back to `.m3u` |
| **Browser** | A responsive channel grid with logos, live program titles and progress, favorites, and posters for matched titles |
| **Categories** | A chip strip and a searchable sidebar with counts; a Favorites virtual category; live text search |
| **Top networks** | Auto generated curated network rows by region (US, UK, Brazil and more), with HD preferring channel scoring |
| **EPG guide** | A horizontal timeline grid with a Now indicator and per program blocks; ended programs with catchup are replayable |
| **Catchup** | Auto detected timeshift across default, append, shift, flussonic, and Xtream methods |
| **Multiview** | One, two, three, or 2x2 streams at once; per tile channel swap, audio focus, and auto reconnect; native video geometry synced to the window layout |

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">&#9650; back to top</a></p>

### Anime

Anime is a first class room with its own metadata stack. Metadata comes from **Kitsu** and **AniZip** for cross database ID mapping and per episode detail, with TMDB matching for logos and backdrops. Award winners from the Crunchyroll Awards, TAAF, JMAF, r/anime, and Animation Kobe are surfaced first and badged. Detail pages show MAL scores, streaming service chips (Crunchyroll, HIDIVE, Funimation and more), and an award corner. AniSkip drives skip intro/outro, and Anime4K shaders sharpen playback.

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">&#9650; back to top</a></p>

### Addons

The Addons room is a full browser and installer for the Stremio ecosystem.

- **Discover** trending and top community addons via the [stremio-addons.net](https://stremio-addons.net) index.
- **Browse** by category and open an addon's detail page with related and recommended addons.
- **Install** from the catalog, add by URL, or follow a `harbor://` / `stremio://` deep link.
- **Configure** addons that require setup: Harbor opens the addon's own configuration view rather than installing without it.
- **Manage** installed addons, which also sync to your Stremio account collection.
- An age gate keeps adult addons behind an explicit opt in.

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">&#9650; back to top</a></p>

### Themes and customization

Harbor's theme engine changes more than colors. A theme can reshape the entire navigation layout.

| | |
|---|---|
| **11 presets** | Harbor (default), Nord, Stremio, Crunchy, Royal, Dracula, Forest, Noir, Aurora, MinUI, Velvet |
| **Layouts** | Left sidebar, top dock, icon rail, Stremio rail, floating dock, or fully custom HTML/CSS chrome |
| **Fonts** | Seven pairings plus custom TTF/OTF/WOFF/WOFF2 upload |
| **Surfaces** | Five card styles, four button styles, an optional animated bokeh layer, and a full bleed background image with a dim slider |
| **Theme Studio** | A live slide in editor with Look, Layout, and Code tabs; a 10 swatch color editor; a custom chrome builder; raw CSS/HTML/JS layers; and a built in cheat sheet |
| **Library** | Import and export `.harborstyle` files, manage a personal theme library, and apply, copy, download, or delete any theme, with a badge marking imported themes |

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">&#9650; back to top</a></p>

### Integrations

| Service | What it adds |
|---|---|
| **Cinemeta** | Works out of the box: catalogs, metadata, and posters with no key |
| **TMDB** (free key) | Trending, In Theaters, On The Air, Top Rated, and eight per service rails (Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Prime, Apple TV+, Max, Paramount+, Peacock), region aware Watch on chips, trailers, full cast and crew, and IMDb ID resolution |

| **Trakt** | OAuth device sign in, automatic scrobbling, watchlist and history, personalized movie and series recommendations, an Up Next calendar rail, and your avatar in the sidebar |
| **Stremio** | Account sign in, Continue Watching sync, installed-addon collection sync, and catalog, meta, stream, and subtitle resources from every installed addon |
| **Debrid** | Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, Premiumize, Debrid-Link, and TorBox for cached, instant playback |

> [!TIP]
> A free TMDB key from [themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) is the single highest impact thing you can add. No payment required.

## Privacy

Harbor is built to keep your data on your machine.

- **No telemetry.** Harbor collects no analytics and sends nothing home.
- **Your keys stay local.** TMDB, RPDB, OMDB, Trakt, and debrid credentials live on your device.
- **No central server.** Watch party relays deploy to your own Cloudflare account, and casting runs on your own network. Nothing is routed through a Harbor operated backend.
- **A built in privacy blocker** at the WebView level, with a live counter.
- **You choose your sources.** What metadata and streams Harbor sees is entirely determined by the addons and services you configure.

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">&#9650; back to top</a></p>

## Install

Download the latest build for macOS or Windows from the [Releases page][releases], or open Harbor in your browser.

|---|---|
| **macOS** | `.dmg` (macOS 11.0 or newer) |
| **Windows** | `.exe` NSIS installer (current user install) |
| **Web** | Open in any modern browser, nothing to install |
| **Linux** | In testing, coming soon (`.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.AppImage` planned) |

### Linux (in testing, coming soon)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://harbor.site/readme-media/linux.png" width="900">
  <br/>
  <sub>Harbor running natively on Linux, in a Together watch party.</sub>
</p>

Linux is up and running natively, and it is in active testing right now. We decided to take a couple extra weeks so the native player feels great for full time Linux users before we call it ready. Coming soon.

**Out of the box, Harbor works on Cinemeta.** You can browse, play, and cast immediately. Adding a free **TMDB key** in Settings is optional and unlocks the richer trending, theaters, per service, and Watch on experiences described above. Your installed Stremio addons merge in automatically when you sign in, deduplicated against the built in rails.

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">&#9650; back to top</a></p>

## Configuration

All keys and preferences live in **Settings** and persist locally. Nothing is sent to a Harbor server.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Stremio sign in` | signed out | Library sync, Continue Watching, and installed-addon collection |

## Build from source

Harbor is a Tauri 2 app: a React + TypeScript frontend and a Rust shell, with the stream engine living in the `harbor-core` Rust crate.

**Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- The [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (stable)
- The [Tauri 2 system prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS
- [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) (only needed to rebuild the WASM stream core)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before your first build, run `pnpm run setup`. It fetches the native sidecars (libmpv, yt-dlp, ffmpeg, ffprobe) and the bundled fonts into `src-tauri/`. These are platform specific and not committed, so a fresh clone will not build without this step. On Linux, extracting the ffmpeg static build needs `tar` and `xz`.

## Roadmap

Directional, not a set of promises. Priorities shift with feedback.

- [x] Native libmpv player with trickplay and skip segments
- [x] Rust stream ranking core (`harbor-core`) compiled to WASM
- [x] Watch parties with cursors and drawing on a self hosted relay
- [x] Live TV EPG guide and Multiview
- [x] First class anime room with Kitsu and AniZip
- [x] Theme studio with custom layouts
- [x] macOS, Windows, and web launch builds
- [ ] Native Linux build (in testing, a couple weeks of native player polish to go)
- [ ] Expanded casting device matrix (AirPlay 2, more Roku and Chromecast targets)
- [ ] More translations
- [ ] A growing theme gallery

## FAQ

**Does Harbor provide content?**
No. Harbor hosts and indexes nothing. It is a client for the Stremio addon protocol, and what you can browse or play depends entirely on the addons and services you configure.

**Do I need a TMDB key?**
No. Harbor works out of the box on Cinemeta. A free TMDB key is recommended because it unlocks trending rails, in theaters, top rated, per service rows, and Watch on chips.

**Is Harbor affiliated with Stremio?**
No. Harbor is an independent open source client built on the open Stremio addon protocol, by someone who loves the ecosystem.

**Why Tauri instead of Electron?**
Tauri uses the system WebView and a Rust backend, which keeps the app small and lets the stream ranking core run as compiled WebAssembly.

**Do I need a debrid account?**
No. You can stream torrents directly through the bundled Stremio Server engine. A debrid service is optional and adds cached, instant playback.
